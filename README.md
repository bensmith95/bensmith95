👋 Hi, I’m Ben Smith, currently a Mathematics PhD student at the University of Leicester researching transition in complex flows.

👀 I’m interested in fluid dynamics (Flow Simulation, Boundary Layer flows, Hydrodynamic Stability) and numerical methods (PDEs, Finite Elements, DNS). 

🌱 My current research has focussed on analysing the flow around a rotating sphere, in particular the physical mechanisms behind the main characteristics of the flow such as the toroidal vortex around the equator.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! (within reason...👀) 

📫 How to reach me: Email - bjs30@leicester.ac.uk
