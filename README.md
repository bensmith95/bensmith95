- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben Smith, currently a Mathematics PhD student at the University of Leicester researching transition in complex flows.
- 👀 I’m interested in fluid dynamics (flow simulation, boundary layers, stability analysis) and numerical methods (PDEs, finite elements, Navier Stokes).
- 🌱 I’m currently working on the steady flow around a rotating sphere at large Reynolds numbers and incorporating a variable viscosity. 
This includes finding relatively simpler models to the full Navier Stokes equations and numerically computing solutions to both the simpler models and full system.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! (within reason...👀)
- 📫 How to reach me: Email - bjs30@le.ac.uk
